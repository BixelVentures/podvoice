# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- **Pluggable voice brain** — choose **Gemini Live** (default; best Danish, lowest cost)
  or **OpenAI Realtime** (`gpt-realtime`) from the panel.
- **Sidebar panel** restyled to match PodConnect (light/translucent, adapts to dark).
- **Talk to Gemini** console in the panel — type and hear spoken replies with a live
  transcript; mic auto-enables on a secure origin (HTTPS / Nabu Casa / localhost).
- **Provider + model selectors** in the console; voice-capable models flagged.
- **Simplified setup** — the Configuration tab now holds **only the API keys**
  (`gemini_api_key`, optional `openai_api_key`). Everything else (provider, models,
  PodConnect URL/token, Voice-PE PSK, rooms, tuning, simulation) is on the panel's
  **Settings** page with one-click **Save & restart**.
- **Simulation mode** — watch the full duck → speak → lounge → release flow with no
  hardware or keys.
- Live status, ducking meter, transcript, controls, metrics, and `/health` in the panel.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release: gatekeeper service, HA add-on packaging, custom Voice PE firmware
  sketch, and the S1/S2 hardware spikes.
